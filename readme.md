## Copying Student Exercises

So far you've used a few different Python modules, but for the rest of the homework, you will need to familiarize yourself with a new one. The `shutil` module is a Python module used for high-level file operations like moving and copying. Read [this beforehand](https://www.journaldev.com/20536/python-shutil-module) to get familiar with `shutil` and make sure to use the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/shutil.html#module-shutil) while you're working through the homework. 

Create a script called `copy_activities.py` with a function called `stu_activities` that does the following:

* Finds files in `~/Downloads` that contain the string `Stu_`
* Copies these files (using the folders naming convention) into the correct Week and Day directory within the `CyberSecurity-Notes` directory created in part 1.

**Note**: This isn't just a challenge to complete for the sake of it, this is a practical script you can run to move any downloaded files from class into your class notes directories.
